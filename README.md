# neuralnetworks.thought-experiments
A repo of observations and notes to understand the workings of neural network models and other simple thought experiments using Tensorflow.

 - Activations - Notes on activation functions with experimental results to compare models on MNIST and CIFAR10
 - Generative Models - Observations on generative machine learning and results using Auto Encoders, VAEs and GANs
 - Model Pruning - Results on doing pruning in neural networks. (mainly OBD as of now.)
